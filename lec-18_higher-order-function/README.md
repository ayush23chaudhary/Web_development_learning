<!-- #################################### HIGHER ORDER FUNCTIONS ###################################### -->

higher order function: a function which accepts another finctio as an arguement is called a higher order function. 

# CASE-1: when you have two functions func a and b, assume that function b is sent as an arguement to the other function func a, then we say that the accepting function is your higher order function (a).

# CASE-2: when I have an outer function and inside that function I have anoher function (inner) and I am returning the inner function then the outer function is known as higher order function.

CALL BACK FUNCTION: in case-1 function b and in case-2 inner function is called call-back function.

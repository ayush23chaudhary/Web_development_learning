# //////////////////////METHODS- All the following methods are higher order function \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

1. for-each: which accepts a call back function, that call back function has two arguements that is item and index and it does not retuen anything.

<!-- the length of the returned array from map method willl be the same as the array on which map is used -->
2. map: returns an array and takes two arguements as item and index.

3. filter: it is method which accepts a call back function , it also returns an array but it only return s a truthy value i.e elements which satisfies thegiven condition
<!-- filter returned array length is variable -->

sort and reduce : lern through mdn
4. every: all items should satisfy the condn the return true.

5. some: anyone item satisfies the condn return true.

<!-- ---------------------------------CONSTRUCTOR FUNCTION------------------------------------------------ -->
# 1 whenever we call a function with a new keyword in front of it then that functio is not just a general function but it is knwon as constructor function. 

# 2 the role of a constructor functio is to create objects.

# 3 generally in orer to distuinguish between a normal functio and constructor function we start the costructor function with a capital letter (not compulsory just convention).
